A repo for all the exercises from the Automate the Boring Stuff book by Al Sweigart
A big thank you to Al Sweigart for putting this knowledge out there on the web. You can find his book atÂ https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter0/. He is a great teacher and gets to the core of what is needed from non-programmers trying to use these tools.
If you are interested in learning I highly recommend checking out this book and all his other reading material.
