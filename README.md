A repo for all the exercises from the Automate the Boring Stuff book by Al Sweigart

A big thank you to Al Sweigart for putting this knowledge out there on the web.
You can find his book atÂ the [creative commons website version of the book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc). He is
a great teacher and gets to the core of what is needed from non-programmers
trying to use these tools.

If you are interested in learning, I highly recommend checking out this book and all his other reading material.
